## Scrape Instagram Followers from Username

Scrapes Instagram Followers from Username. Works flawlessly.

* Grabs Follower Count
* Grabs UserID
* Puts followers into list

Grabs 12 accounts at a time, depends on how you have your delay limit set.

Upload your Instagram cookies to file ```cookies.txt```

Usage: ```scrape.php?username=statemnd&delay=3```

Delay = How long to wait per scraping next list (I usually have it set to 3 seconds to prevent limitation)
