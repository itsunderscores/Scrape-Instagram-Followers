## Scrape Instagram Followers from Username

Scrapes Instagram Followers from Username. Works flawlessly.

* Grabs Follower Count
* Grabs UserID
* Puts followers into list
* Select how many accounts to grab per request

Upload your Instagram cookies to file ```cookies.txt```

Usage: ```scrape.php?username=statemnd&delay=3&grab=100```

Delay = How long to wait per scraping next list (I usually have it set to 3 seconds to prevent limitation)

Grab = How many accounts to grab per request (Instagram usually has it set to 12, I wouldn't recommend going over 1,000 due to getting blocked)
